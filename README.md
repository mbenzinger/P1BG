Flip Err on his head, best out of 7 to win, while he and Ignignokt sass off.
After you win or loose, reset the game to try again.

Problems:

I don't know how to set the scenery except though a background image, which doesn't seem to produce results I want. but I cannot insert an image and configure it to appear as a background- it appears as a new object and competes for space with the other objects.

I want a solid bar below and above the image bank, but cann't figure out how to get that.

I'd like to change the scenery each time the game resets but cannot figure out how to do so with a background image.

It's all too large, scenery, images, etc. and I can't figure out how to shrink it.

I don't know why the characters jump when the text wraps.

I had wanted the caracters to move more. like spin when I flip or the ship take off when the player wins, but can't figure out how to do it.

The sass content is taken from another activity, and not really hooked up to this project, because I can't figure out how I would do that.  I struggle wtih applying even basic css and cannot conceptualize the use sass despite understanding the logic of it.  it's like baking a cake out of a bunch of crumbs.
